= HasEnum

The has_enum extension provides an association with an enumeration class which requires the renum gem (sudo gem install renum).

*Note*: We prefer to use the pkwde renum fork: github.com/pkwde/renum

== Installation

You have to make sure to have a column in your database table to store the string representation of the associated enum instance. The plugin will look
by default for a column named like the enum itself plus the "_type" suffix.

== Example
        
  # Class that has an Enumartion associated

  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_enum :customer_state # needs customer_state_type column in database
  end

  customer = Customer.new

  # Before setting any enum
  customer.customer_state # => nil
  customer.customer_state_type # => ""

  customer.customer_state = CustomerState::Premium
  customer.customer_state # => CustomerState::Premium
  customer.customer_state_type # => "Premium"
  customer.customer_state_has_changed? # => true

  # Define the Enum-Class.
  # For more information have a look at the renum gem
  enum :CustomerState do
    attr_reader :monthly_due
  
    Free(0)
    Basic(5.95)
    Premium(19.95)
  
    def init(monthly_due)
      monthly_due = monthly_due
    end
  end

  premium_state = CustomerState::Premium
  premium_state.monthly_due # => 19.95
